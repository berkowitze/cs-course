#!/bin/sh
"exec" "`dirname $0`/../ta/venv/bin/python" "$0" "$@"

is all over the place because it allows the app to run the Python installed for this grading app using a relative path (../ta/venv/bin/python). This allows getting rid of a lot of /course/csxxxx lines which are really annoying when doing setup.

`cs50-rubric-info` which takes a command line path parameter to a JSON file,
for example
`cs50-rubric-info /course/cs0050/ta/grading/data/rubrics/homework4/q1.json`

This effectively pretty-prints the rubric file, so you don't have all the JSON notation and comments floating around.

It's used to print every students rubric into a file in their grade directory
so TAs can easily look at them (though to change things they still have to use the
grading app or modify the JSON directly).
For example, `/course/cs0050/hta/grades/eberkowi/homework1/rubric-summary.txt`.
(the txts won't exist for <= Homework 4 though).
