#!/bin/sh
"exec" "`dirname $0`/../ta/venv/bin/python" "$0" "$@"

is all over the place because it allows the app to run the Python installed for this grading app using a relative path (../ta/venv/bin/python). This allows getting rid of a lot of /course/csxxxx lines which are really annoying when doing setup.
