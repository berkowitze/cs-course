# cs-course

1. Download and rename to /course/cs0111 (yes in root directory, sorry).
2. Install the virtual environment with Python 3.7 (`virtualenv venv -p $(which python3.7)`)
3. Make a groups folder `/ta/groups`
    - Run `touch tas.txt htas.txt students.txt students.csv`
    - Put your user name into tas.txt, htas.txt, and students.txt. Put (username,name,email) into students.csv
      Eli,
