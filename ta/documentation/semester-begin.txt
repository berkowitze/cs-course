Beginning of the semester checklist:

0) Make sure last semester's data is cleared.

1) Copy the handin form over
    a) Make sure grading/handin data from previous year is cleared.
        cs111-asgn-hub > Course Options
    b) Make a copy of the current handin form.
    e) Clear the Forms' responses.
    c) Dump the Forms' responses into a spreadsheet.
    d) Get that spreadsheet's ID and put it into config.py

2) Hookup handin submission checking
    a) Log into a department machine in the TA grading rooms (Blab or Jlab).
       Melissa worked well for the Fall 2018 semester!
    b) Make a crontab using
       crontab -e
    c) Put this into the crontab: (check for handins every 2 minutes)
    */2 * * * * /course/cs0111/htabin/cs111-check-handins

3) While on dept machine, setup group updating.
    a) To get group data, we need to be able to get data on student logins.
       For that we need to be able to login to our Brown account without typing
       in our password every single time the script runs.
       To do this, you need to make a KEYTAB. Generate one with
        cd /course/cs0111/htabin
        ./cs111-generate-keytab
       (using your Brown credentials)

    b) Put the group-updating script into the crontab:
    */20 * * * * /usr/bin/kinit YOURUSERNAME@AD.BROWN.EDU -k -t tab.keytab

4) Setup any configuration needed in config.py.
