High Priority:

High-ish Priority:
    Move email generation to jinja templating, it's more flexible I think
        (especially handin!)

Medium Priority:
    Avoid yagmail for email sending? it's kinda slow... smtplib might be
        better
    Refactor code so that TAs can modify rubrics in the web app
        after emails are sent and regenerate the students grade.
        [difficulty: annoyingly hard?]
    View flag reason if handin is flagged (easy) [working for HTA]
    Go to student's next/last problem (medium)
      grade-override command which gives a prompt:

        Which assignment are you giving a regrade on?
            1. Homework 1
            ...
        Then
        Which student are you viewing/overwriting a grade for?

            1. login-1-graded-for-assignment
            2. login-2-graded-for-assignment
        
        Then it makes override files and either opens in them in
        an explorer or cd's into that folder or something.

    

Low priority:
    Better sidebar colors (easy)
    Panes for sidebar (annoying, unnecessary?)

Done:
    Make cs111-add-asgn better (easy/tedious) (use prompts.py)
    Better comments [done; draggable, editable, etc]
    Add "test" option which spits out results to a modal (medium)
        Run shell script like /course/cs0111/tabin/test pyret filepath
    New rubric item option (hard) [unnecessary] [done with magic_update]
    New rubric item (hard) [unnecessary] [done with magic_update]
    Implement change-point-val into asgn-hub (medium) [done with magic_update]
    Send email to individual student (easy-medium)
    View flagged handins in asgn-hub (medium)
    Report generation: make it work if not all items complete (annoying)
    Deal with late handins (?)
