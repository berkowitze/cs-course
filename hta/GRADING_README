Explanations for HTAs! (And Kathi :) )

Grades:
    grades are stored in /hta/grades/<student-name>/<assignment>
    Each of these folders has:
        - @code: symlink to /ta/grading/data/sfiles/<assignment>/<student>
            tldr cd code will take you to the student's latest submission
        - report.txt: a txt file that has the exact contents of the email
            sent to the student. This file is not used for any grade
            generation or collection.
        - grade.json: a json file with keys for each theme on the homework
            (i.e. "Functionality"), and the value for that theme (i.e. "Check")
            This file is used for grade collection for the gradebook

        - report-override.txt: This should only exist if you are overwriting
            the student's grade or comments for the assignment.
            TODO: when a report-override.txt file is created, also send an
            email to the student with the new report?
        - grade-override.json: if report-override.txt exists, **this must also
            exist**. This has the regraded grades for each category.

        Example regrade:
            cp report.txt report-override.txt && cp grade.json grade-override.json
            <edit the new files>
            <send update to student somehow>

    Brackets and rubrics:
        Do not use negative point values; shift everything to be positive if you
        need some notion of negativity. That is because all grades are 0 by default,
        even for student's who did not hand in a problem or the entire assignment.
